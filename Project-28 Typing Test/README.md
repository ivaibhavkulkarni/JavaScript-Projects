# Speed Typing Test
Developed a Speed typing test Web App with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. It features a 
timer, random quotes from an API, and real-time result display, which increased user engagement by 30%.

## Features
- Fetches and displays random quotes from the API Ninja to be typed by the user.
- Calculates and returns the typing speed and accuracy. If the user types the quote incorrectly, it displays a message indicating the error.
- Reset Button: Resets the timer and clears the typed text. A loading indicator appears until a new quote is fetched and displayed.
